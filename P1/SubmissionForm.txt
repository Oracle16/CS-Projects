Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:

First frame introduces the background scene with a blue sky, tree, loading textured ground blocks, and original title screen.
Golden Goomba (character 1) appears on the original title screen.
As the textured ground blocks finish loading, pipe and hill elements are added to the scene.
The Brown (Walking) Goomba (character 2) then joins using a Layer class.
During this sequence, the Golden Goomba disappears along with the title screen.
Shortly after, the Brown Goomba begins its walk animation, partially obscuring the tree on the right before exiting off-screen to the next level.
Once all Goombas have departed, a final GAME OVER frame is shown.

Although I spent a significant amount of time designing this port, I thoroughly enjoyed learning the fundamentals of cs1graphics through this project. Thanks for playing!
