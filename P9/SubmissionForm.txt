Google/search engine to learn class inheritance from Layer.
---------------------------------------
Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:

This program defines a `Goomba` class that inherits from `cs1graphics.Layer`. The class allows creating Goomba characters with customizable colors (face, body, shoes, eyes, eyebrows) via constructor arguments and methods (`change_face_color`, `change_eye_color`). It also includes methods to change the Goomba's expression (`set_mood`) and perform animations (`bow`, `move_smoothly`). The reference point is the bottom-center between the shoes.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates the class usage. It first draws a theater stage scene using the `draw_theater_stage` function, which includes curtains, overhead lights, a decorated floor, and side plants. It then creates four distinct `Goomba` instances with varying appearances and places them on the stage. An animation sequence follows: the overhead lights perform an orbit, the curtain rises, the Goombas move, change mood, and take a bow, the curtain falls, and finally, the Goombas are removed from the canvas.

No known bugs.

Other comments or response program-specific questions:
This project was a good exercise in applying object-oriented principles, specifically inheritance with `cs1graphics`. Designing the `Goomba` class with customizable features and distinct methods was challenging but rewarding. Creating the theater stage and animation sequence helped solidify understanding of how to use the custom class effectively.
